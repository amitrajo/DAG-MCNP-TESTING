Verification Test Problem: 05
Feature Testing: multiple energy groups 
Brief Description: rectangular prism with reflecting boundaries split into equal
                   water and boron regions by a plane orthogonal to the x-axis

Input files:
-----------
energy_groups.inp - mesh tally input file using native geometry
mcnp_mesh.h5m - orthogonal mesh for KDE tallies
boron_tet_mesh.h5m - tetrahedral mesh for TET track tally (boron region)
water_tet_mesh.h5m - tetrahedral mesh for TET track tally (water region)

Reference files:
---------------
ref/outp - MCNP outp file for this test case
ref/kde_coll.vtk - KDE collision tally results
ref/kde_track.vtk - KDE track tally results
ref/boron_tracklen.vtk - TET track tally results (boron region)
