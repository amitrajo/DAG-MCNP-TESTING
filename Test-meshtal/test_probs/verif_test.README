A summary of the Verification Tests

1: single rectangular prism with uniform materials and reflecting boundaries
2: single rectangular prism with uniform materials and vacuum boundaries
3: rectangular prism divided by a plane orthogonal to the long axis
   reflecting boundaries
   same materials on both sides of plane
4: rectangular prism divided by a plane orthogonal to the long axis
   reflecting boundaries
   different materials on each sided of plane
5: rectangular prism divided by a plane at 45 degrees to the long axis
   reflecting boundaries
   same materials on both sides of plane
6: rectangular prism divided by a plane at 45 degrees to the long axis
   reflecting boundaries
   different materials on each sided of plane

In each directory is a results_90min directory containing results for 
running the tally problems for 90 minutes.  These runs used DAG-MCNP
r265 and the CNERG installation of MOAB r4437.  They were run on 
26 January 2011 on machine syme.

Visualization files from these six benchmarks were used in the ANS
summary submission on January 31.  These visualization files are 
available in ANS11_vis.tar.gz.
