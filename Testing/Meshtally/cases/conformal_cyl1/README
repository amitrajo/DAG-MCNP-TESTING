Verification Test Problem: 07
Feature Testing: conformal mesh 
Brief Description: two cadmium cylinders with different orientations contained
                   within a rectangular prism with reflecting boundaries filled
                   with water 

Input files for left cylinder:
-----------------------------
left_conformal_mesh.inp - mesh tally input file using dagmc geometry
dagmc_preproc_left_cylinder.h5m - dagmc geometry file replacing left
                                  cylinder (vol 2) with mesh
left_cylinder.h5m - tetrahedral mesh for KDE and TET track tallies

Reference files for left cylinder:
---------------------------------
ref/left_outp - MCNP outp file for this test case
ref/left_meshtal - MCNP fmesh tally results (based on dagmc geometry)
*ref/left_kde_coll.vtk - KDE collision tally results
*ref/left_kde_track.vtk - KDE track tally results
ref/left_tracklen.vtk - TET track tally results

* NOTE: the KDE results for this test case are included solely for regression
testing purposes as they are not statistically comparable to MCNP for the
global bandwidth value that was used.  The cause of the bias in the KDE results
is currently under investigation and is expected to be related to the choice of
bandwidth.
