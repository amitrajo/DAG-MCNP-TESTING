These files are a for a very simple mesh tallying test run. Brandon
Smith provided the original squares2 DAGMC problem.

run: script to drive DAGMC to run this problem.  The output mesh tally
     will be saved as tally_out.vtk.
squares2.inp: Input file (slightly modified from Brandon's original to 
              have a mesh tally) 
squares2.sat: Problem geometry
tally.cub: The input for the experimental meshal branch code.  

** About xsdir
Brandon's input file requires some fiddly settings of the
xsdir.  I made it work using symbolic links as follows:

xsdir -> /home/cnerg/opt/mcnp_data/fendl2.1/xsdir
fendl21lib -> /home/cnerg/opt/mcnp_data/fendl2.1/fendl21lib
