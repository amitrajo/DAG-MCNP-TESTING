Verification Test Problem: 08
Feature Testing: uniform volume source 
Brief Description: uniform spherical volume source filled with a "pure"
                   absorber (boron at low neutron energy) 

Input files:
-----------
uniform_vol_source.inp - mesh tally input file using native geometry
tet_mesh.h5m - tetrahedral mesh for KDE and TET track tallies

Reference files:
---------------
ref/outp - MCNP outp file for this test case
*ref/kde_coll.vtk - KDE collision tally results
*ref/kde_track.vtk - KDE track tally results
ref/tracklen.vtk - TET track tally results

* NOTE: the KDE results for this test case are included solely for regression
testing purposes as they are not statistically comparable to MCNP for the
global bandwidth value that was used.  The cause of the bias in the KDE results
is currently under investigation and is expected to be related to the choice of
bandwidth.
