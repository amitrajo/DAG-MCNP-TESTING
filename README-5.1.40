README: DAG-MCNP 5.1.40 Test Suite

--- What's going on in this directory ---
The main dag-mcnp test suite is kept in a parallel directory
under the projects primary 5.1.51 trunk: 

<this_directory>/../../../5.1.51/trunk/Test-dagmc

This directory is a duplicate of the structure of the 5.1.51 
testing directory, and most of the files here are symlinks to the 
corresponding files in that directory.  In a few key cases
(chiefly ref.dag.out files), files specific to the 5.1.40 
branch are kept here.  This allows the greatest possible duplication
between the two versions of the test suite, saving us from
the need to keep multiple copies of large input meshes.

In order for this test suite to work correctly, it must exist
within a complete checkout of the DAG-MCNP repository.  The 
../../../5.1.51/trunk/Test-dagmc directory must exist for the 
test suite in this directory to function.
